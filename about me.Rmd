## Brief overview

Experienced researcher with a demonstrated history of working in the consulting, venture capital, and academia. Skilled in data analysis, public speaking, and content operations. Strong business development professional, with a MPH focused in Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Health Data Science from Columbia University.
