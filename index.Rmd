## Problem 2

Create a flexdashboard using `plotly` for that includes at least three distinct plot types (e.g. scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, etc.). 

Use one of the following datasets, and load from the p8105.datasets package:

* Instacart
* NY NOAA
* NYC Restaurant Inspections

These datasets are large; you may want / need to filter or randomly sample from the complete dataset to ensure a reasonable product.
