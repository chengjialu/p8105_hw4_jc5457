This landing page is created for p8105_hw4 by jc5457.

## Problem 1

Create a personal website at chengjialu.github.io, include:

1. A brief introductory landing page (this page)

2. A page giving my academic and professional experience:

    [About Me](about-me.html) includes 
    * the brief overview about me
    * my embeded resume
    * my contact


3. Links in the site navigation for my GitHub account, my email, and other professional networks.
    
    * Github and email icon can be found on the top right corner of the website.
    * Other contact information: See "contact" tab in  [About Me](about-me.html)


## Problem 2

Create a flexdashboard using `plotly` for that includes at least three distinct plot types (e.g. scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, etc.). 

Use one of the following datasets, and load from the p8105.datasets package:

* Instacart
* NY NOAA
* NYC Restaurant Inspections

These datasets are large; you may want / need to filter or randomly sample from the complete dataset to ensure a reasonable product.
